inverse kinematics of a position Fn given with qn=[0 pi/4 pi 0 pi/4  0]; is returned as:

In =

   -0.0001   -0.8335    0.0939    0.0001   -0.8312   -0.0001


position Fn achieved with direct kinematics using qn is:

Fn = [   0         0         1    0.5963
         0         1         0   -0.1501
        -1         0         0  -0.01435
         0         0         0         1 ];
