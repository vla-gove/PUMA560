inverse kinematics of a position Fs given with qs = [0 0 -pi/2 0 0 0]; is returned as:

Is =

   -0.0001   -0.0466   -1.4777    0.0012   -0.0465   -0.0012


position Fs achieved with direct kinematics using qs is:

Fs = [   0         0         1    0.8636
         0         1         0   -0.1501
        -1         0         0   -0.0203
         0         0         0         1 ];
